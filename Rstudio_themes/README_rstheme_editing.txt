# Edits to Rstudio themes

To change the background colour of chunks for visual editing in 
Rstudio you need to change the hex colour in this section of
the .rstheme file

.ace_marker-layer .ace_foreign_line {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: -1;
  background-color: #3D444E;
}

My preferences:
* Dracula = #484c75
